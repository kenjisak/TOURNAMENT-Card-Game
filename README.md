# üé≤ Tournament of Cards

This project involved designing and implementing a multiplayer, turn-based card game from scratch using disciplined software engineering practices, including **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**. Built in two major phases, the project focused first on core game mechanics and unit testing, followed by automated acceptance testing using **Cucumber** and **JUnit**.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Contributions

- Applied **TDD** rigorously in the initial phase of development, implementing core responsibilities of the game by writing unit tests first (U-TEST), then writing production code (CODE) to pass those tests.
- Maintained clean commit discipline by separating test code and implementation logic into distinct commits for traceability and maintainability.
- Learned and used **Cucumber** to write **Gherkin-based acceptance tests** simulating realistic and complex game scenarios from a player perspective.
- Authored detailed feature files to test:
  - Valid and invalid input handling
  - Rule enforcement (e.g., card limits, turn order, shaming rules)
  - Edge cases including no winners, multiple winners, and disqualification
- Designed and executed **24+ scenario-based melee tests** using example tables to simulate variations in player behavior and game state.
- Integrated **JUnit** and **Cucumber** for seamless acceptance test execution, automated reporting, and CI/CD compatibility.
- Created a professional demo video walking through project setup and one-shot execution of all acceptance tests within IntelliJ.

## üß∞ Technologies Used

- **Java** for core game development
- **Cucumber** for behavior-driven development and Gherkin feature definition
- **JUnit** for unit and acceptance test execution
- **IntelliJ IDEA** for development and testing
- **Git** for version control and disciplined commit history

## üéì Skills Developed

- End-to-end development using TDD and BDD methodologies
- Mastery of acceptance testing design with reusable scenario templates
- Advanced debugging and test data generation for multiplayer systems
- Integration of Cucumber with JUnit for automated test execution
- Video-based communication of technical workflows for assessment or team onboarding
